Collect data for the Aviator betting game

## First

You need Chrome running on Linux for this to work!  
Set the chrome bin path in `scripts/start-chrome.sh`.  
Example: `CHROME="/opt/google/chrome/chrome"`

## Second

Install the dependencies

```shell
npm i .
```

## Third

Launch

```shell
export BETIKA_PHONE="712345678" && export BETIKA_PASSWORD="4321abcd"
npm start
```

Wait for a few seconds for Chrome to come up.  
If you're running this for the first time then you need to login manually and then leave it.  
Check `output/` for new data points.

## Fourth

Now you have the data go do what you wanted. :-]
